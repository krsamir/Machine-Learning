# Model Selection and Boosting
After we built our Machine Learning models, some questions remained unanswered:

1. How to deal with the bias variance tradeoff when building a model and evaluating its performance ?
2. How to choose the optimal values for the hyperparameters (the parameters that are not learned) ?
3.  How to find the most appropriate Machine Learning model for my business problem ?<br>

So we will apply some Model selection Techniques such as :
1. k-Fold Cross Validation
2. Grid Search
