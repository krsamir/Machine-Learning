    "A one-Armed bandit is a slot machine which has a handle that needs to pulled to initite the game. There is 50-50 chance of winning this game. But putting bug(kind of) into the machine people genrally lost the game, which was a genrally like a bandit.<br>\n",
    "If there is a set of such kind of machines then it is known as multi-bandit machine.<br>\n",
    "So the question which arises here is that how will we play that game to maximise our return?<br><br>\n",
    "So each machine has a distribution behind it from which the machine picks its result.<br>\n",
    "The **problem** here is that we don't know what is the distribution behind the machine. Generally it is being assumed that the distributions are different for different machines.<br>\n",
    "The **goal** is to figure out which distribution is best for us.<br>\n"
