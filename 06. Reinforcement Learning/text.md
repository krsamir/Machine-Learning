# Reinforcement Learning
***
Reinforcement Learning is a powerful branch of Machine Learning. It is used to solve interacting problems where the data observed up to time t is considered to decide which action to take at time t + 1. It is also used for Artificial Intelligence when training machines to perform tasks such as walking. Desired outcomes provide the AI with reward, undesired with punishment. Machines learn through trial and error.
